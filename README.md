# Work Day Scheduler

"Work Day Scheduler" application was created using JavaScript and jQuery. It is a homework project, created while I'm attending the Web Development Course at UofT School of Continuing Studies.

## Visuals

## Usage

User will notice following files: 'index.html','style.css' and 'script.js'. Also, there's a README file.
User will see table rows painted in different colors: lightgray for past time, red for current time and lightgreen for future time. User can enter input which, on a click of the button, will be saved into Local Storage as well as in the table itself. User can delete and change his inputs as he wishes.
Link to a deployed application you can find here: https://ivanduranic.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

## Support

I have used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library while working with date and time.

## Roadmap

Work Day Scheduler application will be updated and perfected as my knowledge progresses.
